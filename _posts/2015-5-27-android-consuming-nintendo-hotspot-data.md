<p>I recently <a href="https://flyingsparx.net/blog/2015/5/12/nintendos-hotspot-api" target="_blank">blogged about</a> Nintendo Hotspot data and mentioned it could be more usefully consumable in a native mobile app.</p>

<p>As such, I wrote a small Android app for retrieving this data and displaying it on a Google Map. The app shows nearby hotspots, allows users to also search for other non-local places, and shows information on the venue hosting the zone.</p>

<p>The app is available on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.flyingsparx.spotpassandroid" target="_blank">Play Store</a> and its source is published on <a href="https://github.com/flyingsparx/NZone-finder" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
