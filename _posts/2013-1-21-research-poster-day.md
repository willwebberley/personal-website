<p>
Each January the School of Computer Science hosts a poster day in order for the research students to demonstrate their current work to
other research students, research staff and undergraduates. The event lets members of the department see what other research is being done outside of their own group and gives researchers an opportunity to defend their research ideas.
</p>
<p>This year, I focused on my current research area, which is to do with inferring how interesting a Tweet is based on a comparison between simulated retweet patterns and the propagation behaviour demonstrated by the Tweet in Twitter itself. The poster highlights recent work in the build-up to this, a general overview of how the research works, and finishes with where I want to take this research in the future.</p>
<p>The poster is available <a href="http://www.willwebberley.net/downloads/poster_day_2013.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
